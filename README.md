# Week 1: Python Basics - Your First Steps in Programming

## 📚 Theory Concepts
- What is programming? Understanding Python as a beginner-friendly language
- Variables: Containers to store data (numbers, text, True/False values)
- Basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Strings: Working with text data - creating, combining, and basic operations
- Lists: Collections of items and how to access them
- Your first program: Understanding how code runs step by step

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice
- Installed Python on my system
- Wrote and ran my first 'Hello World' program
- Created variables to store personal information (name, age, city)
- Practiced basic math calculations in Python
- Created a list of my favorite foods and accessed them
- Built a simple bio-data program to display my information

## 🎯 Project: Personal Introduction Program
- Program asks for user's name, age, and hobby
- Displays a friendly welcome message with user information

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements Implemented
- Used `input()` to get user information
- Used variables to store answers
- Used `print()` to display welcome message
- Added at least 3 questions
- Output is friendly and welcoming

## 📋 Step-by-Step Guide
- **Day 1:** Setup & Hello World
- **Day 2:** Add User Input
- **Day 3:** Welcome Message with f-strings
- **Day 4:** Enhance Program with more questions
- **Day 5:** Finalize & Test
# Day 1: Hello World
print("Hello World")
# Day 2: User Input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
city = input("Enter your city: ")

print("Name:", Krishna)
print("Age:", 22)
print("City:", Bhusawal)
# Day 3: Welcome Message
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
hobby = input("Enter your hobby: ")

print(f"Welcome {Krishna}! You are {22} years old and enjoy {Travel}.")
# Day 4: Enhanced Program
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
hobby = input("Enter your hobby: ")
city = input("Enter your city: ")

print(f"Hello {Krishna} from {Bhusawal}!")
print(f"You are {22} years old and love {Travel}.")
print("Nice to meet you!")
# Day 5: Final Version - Personal Introduction Program
print("Welcome to my personal introduction program!")

name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
hobby = input("What's your favorite hobby? ")
city = input("Where do you live? ")
food = input("What's your favorite food? ")

print("\n--- Your Profile ---")
print(f"Name: {Krishna}")
print(f"Age: {22}")
print(f"Hobby: {Travel}")
print(f"City: {Bhusawal}")
print(f"Favorite Food: {Paneer}")
print("\nThank you for sharing! Have a great day!")
